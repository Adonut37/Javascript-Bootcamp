# Javascript Bootcamp
Week 1
Students will begin by covering fundamental concepts of JavaScript and computational thinking. They will set up everything they need on their machine in order to dive into coding, including functions, arrays, and scope. Throughout Week 1, they will be executing code and even exploring simple 2D animation, finally building up to working with callback functions,  and some of the newest features of ECMAScript, the standard for JavaScript, which will lay a foundation for working with asynchronous code.

Week 2
This week, students will delve deeper into JavaScript, continuing their exploration of asynchronous code, fetching data, and promises. Theyâ€™ll hone their skills as programmers working more with Bootstrap, more HTML and CSS. Students will put all their skills together and finish out strong building a project for their portfolio and GitHub to show off their new coding prowess."
